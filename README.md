# The Back of an iPod ðŸª©

This was a tiny UIKit experiment where I tried to recreate the shiny aluminum/stainless steel backs of the last generation iPod Classic that Apple produced as an app.

I've seen several 'shiny' UI demos over the past few weeks on Twitter so I figured I'd give it a whirl as well :)

[Video Demo](https://i.imgur.com/AJgrdQm.mp4).

The camera distortion effect is done using Apple's built-in Core Image library, and more specifically the [CIBumpDistortionLinear Filter](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CoreImageFilterReference/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/filter/ci/CIBumpDistortionLinear). The front-facing camera runs at 60 FPS (at slightly lower quality) to really give it that mirror-like effect and the bevel is just an image overlay :)
